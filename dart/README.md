# Effective Dart Style

A surprisingly important part of good code is good style. Consistent naming,
ordering, and formatting helps code that _is_ the same _look_ the same. It takes
advantage of the powerful pattern-matching hardware most of us have in our
ocular systems. If we use a consistent style across the entire Dart ecosystem,
it makes it easier for all of us to learn from and contribute to each others'
code.

## Identifiers

Identifiers come in three flavors in Dart.

- `UpperCamelCase` names capitalize the first letter of each word, including
  the first.

- `lowerCamelCase` names capitalize the first letter of each word, _except_
  the first which is always lowercase, even if it's an acronym.

- `lowercase_with_underscores` use only lowercase letters, even for acronyms,
  and separate words with `_`.

### DO name types using `UpperCamelCase`.

Classes, enum types, typedefs, and type parameters should capitalize the first
letter of each word (including the first word), and use no separators.

_`good`_

```dart
class SliderMenu { ... }

class HttpRequest { ... }

typedef Predicate<T> = bool Function(T value);
```

This even includes classes intended to be used in metadata annotations.

_`good`_

```dart
class Foo {
const Foo([arg]);
}

@Foo(anArg)
class A { ... }

@Foo()
class B { ... }
```

If the annotation class's constructor takes no parameters, you might want to
create a separate `lowerCamelCase` constant for it.

_`good`_

```dart
const foo = Foo();

@foo
class C { ... }
```

### DO name extensions using `UpperCamelCase`.

Like types, extensions should capitalize the first letter of each word
(including the first word),
and use no separators.

_`good`_

```dart
extension MyFancyList<T> on List<T> { ... }

extension SmartIterable<T> on Iterable<T> { ... }
```

> Extensions are a Dart 2.7 language feature.
> For details, see the [extensions design document.][]

### DO name libraries, packages, directories, and source files using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to
be all lowercase. Using a separating character allows names to still be readable
in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still
a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports
symbolic imports.

_`good`_

```dart
library peg_parser.source_scanner;

import 'file_system.dart';
import 'slider_menu.dart';
```

_`bad`_

```dart
library pegparser.SourceScanner;

import 'file-system.dart';
import 'SliderMenu.dart';
```

  **Note:** This guideline specifies *how* to name a library *if you choose to
  name it*. It is fine to _omit_ the library directive in a file if you want.
</aside>

### DO name import prefixes using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

_`good`_

```dart
import 'dart:math' as math;
import 'package:angular_components/angular_components'
as angular_components;
import 'package:js/js.dart' as js;
```

_`bad`_

```dart
import 'dart:math' as Math;
import 'package:angular_components/angular_components'
as angularComponents;
import 'package:js/js.dart' as JS;
```

### DO name other identifiers using `lowerCamelCase`.

Class members, top-level definitions, variables, parameters, and named
parameters should capitalize the first letter of each word _except_ the first
word, and use no separators.

_`good`_

```dart
var item;

HttpRequest httpRequest;

void align(bool clearItems) {
// ...
}
```

### PREFER using `lowerCamelCase` for constant names.

In new code, use `lowerCamelCase` for constant variables, including enum values.

_`good`_

```dart
const pi = 3.14;
const defaultTimeout = 1000;
final urlScheme = RegExp('^([a-z]+):');

class Dice {
static final numberGenerator = Random();
}
```

_`bad`_

```dart
const PI = 3.14;
const DefaultTimeout = 1000;
final URL_SCHEME = RegExp('^([a-z]+):');

class Dice {
static final NUMBER_GENERATOR = Random();
}
```

You may use `SCREAMING_CAPS` for consistency with existing code,
as in the following cases:

- When adding code to a file or library that already uses `SCREAMING_CAPS`.
- When generating Dart code that's parallel to Java code â€”
  for example, in enumerated types generated from [protobufs.][]

  > **Note:** We initially used Java's `SCREAMING_CAPS` style for constants. We
  > changed for a few reasons:

- `SCREAMING_CAPS` looks bad for many cases, particularly enum values for
  things like CSS colors.
- Constants are often changed to final non-const variables, which would
  necessitate a name change.
- The `values` property automatically defined on an enum type is const and
  lowercase.

[protobufs.]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/protobuf

### DO capitalize acronyms and abbreviations longer than two letters like words.

Capitalized acronyms can be hard to read, and
multiple adjacent acronyms can lead to ambiguous names.
For example, given a name that starts with `HTTPSFTP`, there's no way
to tell if it's referring to HTTPS FTP or HTTP SFTP.

To avoid this, acronyms and abbreviations are capitalized like regular words,
except for two-letter acronyms. (Two-letter _abbreviations_ like
ID and Mr. are still capitalized like words.)

_`good`_

```dart
HttpConnectionInfo
uiHandler
IOStream
HttpRequest
Id
DBIOPort
TVVcr
```

_`bad`_

```dart
HTTPConnection
UiHandler
IoStream
HTTPRequest
ID
DbIoPort
TvVcr
```

### DON'T use a leading underscore for identifiers that aren't private.

Dart uses a leading underscore in an identifier to mark members and top-level
declarations as private. This trains users to associate a leading underscore
with one of those kinds of declarations. They see "\_" and think "private".

There is no concept of "private" for local variables, parameters, or library
prefixes. When one of those has a name that starts with an underscore, it sends
a confusing signal to the reader. To avoid that, don't use leading underscores
in those names.

**Exception:** An unused parameter can be named `_`, `__`, `___`, etc. This
happens in things like callbacks where you are passed a value but you don't need
to use it. Giving it a name that consists _solely_ of underscores is the
idiomatic way to indicate the value isn't used.

### DON'T use prefix letters.

[Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) and
other schemes arose in the time of BCPL, when the compiler didn't do much to
help you understand your code. Because Dart can tell you the type, scope,
mutability, and other properties of your declarations, there's no reason to
encode those properties in identifier names.

_`good`_

```dart
defaultTimeout
```

_`bad`_

```dart
kDefaultTimeout
```

## Ordering

To keep the preamble of your file tidy, we have a prescribed order that
directives should appear in. Each "section" should be separated by a blank line.

A single linter rule handles all the ordering guidelines:
[directives_ordering.]({{ site.lints }}/directives_ordering.html)

### DO place "dart:" imports before other imports.

_`good`_

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:html';

import 'package:bar/bar.dart';
import 'package:foo/foo.dart';
```

### DO place "package:" imports before relative imports.

_`good`_

```dart
import 'package:bar/bar.dart';
import 'package:foo/foo.dart';

import 'util.dart';
```

### DO specify exports in a separate section after all imports.

_`good`_

```dart
import 'src/error.dart';
import 'src/foo_bar.dart';

export 'src/error.dart';
```

_`bad`_

```dart
import 'src/error.dart';
export 'src/error.dart';
import 'src/foo_bar.dart';
```

### DO sort sections alphabetically.

_`good`_

```dart
import 'package:bar/bar.dart';
import 'package:foo/foo.dart';

import 'foo.dart';
import 'foo/foo.dart';
```

_`bad`_

```dart
import 'package:foo/foo.dart';
import 'package:bar/bar.dart';

import 'foo/foo.dart';
import 'foo.dart';
```

## Formatting

Like many languages, Dart ignores whitespace. However, _humans_ don't. Having a
consistent whitespace style helps ensure that human readers see code the same
way the compiler does.

### DO format your code using `dartfmt`.

Formatting is tedious work and is particularly time-consuming during
refactoring. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about it. We provide a
sophisticated automated code formatter called [dartfmt][] that does it for
you. We have [some documentation][dartfmt docs] on the rules it applies, but the
official whitespace-handling rules for Dart are _whatever dartfmt produces_.

The remaining formatting guidelines are for the few things dartfmt cannot fix
for you.

### CONSIDER changing your code to make it more formatter-friendly.

The formatter does the best it can with whatever code you throw at it, but it
can't work miracles. If your code has particularly long identifiers, deeply
nested expressions, a mixture of different kinds of operators, etc. the
formatted output may still be hard to read.

When that happens, reorganize or simplify your code. Consider shortening a local
variable name or hoisting out an expression into a new local variable. In other
words, make the same kinds of modifications that you'd make if you were
formatting the code by hand and trying to make it more readable. Think of
dartfmt as a partnership where you work together, sometimes iteratively, to
produce beautiful code.

### AVOID lines longer than 80 characters.

Readability studies show that long lines of text are harder to read because your
eye has to travel farther when moving to the beginning of the next line. This is
why newspapers and magazines use multiple columns of text.

If you really find yourself wanting lines longer than 80 characters, our
experience is that your code is likely too verbose and could be a little more
compact. The main offender is usually `VeryLongCamelCaseClassNames`. Ask
yourself, "Does each word in that type name tell me something critical or
prevent a name collision?" If not, consider omitting it.

Note that dartfmt does 99% of this for you, but the last 1% is you. It does not
split long string literals to fit in 80 columns, so you have to do that
manually.

**Exception:** When a URI or file path occurs in a comment or string (usually in
an import or export), it may remain whole even if it causes the line to go over
80 characters. This makes it easier to search source files for a path.

**Exception:** Multi-line strings can contain lines longer than 80 characters
because newlines are significant inside the string and splitting the lines into
shorter ones can alter the program.

### DO use curly braces for all flow control statements.

Doing so avoids the [dangling else][] problem.

[dangling else]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else

_`good`_

```dart
if (isWeekDay) {
print('Bike to work!');
} else {
print('Go dancing or read a book!');
}
```

**Exception:** When you have an `if` statement with no `else` clause and the
whole `if` statement fits on one line, you can omit the braces if you prefer:

_`good`_

```dart
if (arg == null) return defaultValue;
```

If the body wraps to the next line, though, use braces:

_`good`_

```dart
if (overflowChars != other.overflowChars) {
return overflowChars < other.overflowChars;
}
```

_`bad`_

```dart
if (overflowChars != other.overflowChars)
return overflowChars < other.overflowChars;
```
